    "question": "Sophia is a shopping enthusiast who spends significant time searching for trendy outfits online. Clark, an attacker, noticed her activities several times and sent a fake email containing a deceptive page link to her social media page displaying all-new and trendy outfits. In excitement, Sophia clicked on the malicious link and logged in to that page using her valid credentials. Which of the following tools is employed by Clark to create the spoofed email?",

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Evilginx** Scenario recap: An attacker observes Sophia’s online shopping habits and sends her a fake email with a deceptive link to a spoofed login page, where she submits valid credentials. Why this answer is correct: In CEH terminology this is a classic computer-based social engineering attack using a phishing email that leads to a cloned or spoofed authentication page to steal credentials; Evilginx is a credential-harvesting framework designed specifically to create such fake login portals and man-in-the-middle phishing links, making it the only option that matches the described behavior. Why the other options are wrong: Slowloris and PyLoris are application-layer denial-of-service tools used to exhaust web server resources, not to build spoofed emails or phishing pages; PLCinject relates to attacks on industrial control systems and PLCs, not end-user credential harvesting through fake shopping or social media pages. KEY CONCEPTS: computer-based social engineering, phishing emails, spoofed login pages, credential harvesting frameworks.

Why this answer is correct: CEH defines pharming as redirecting traffic from a legitimate site to a malicious one, often by manipulating DNS or hosts file entries, with the goal of harvesting credentials and personal data; the scenario explicitly mentions DNS cache poisoning and redirection to a fake site, which is exactly pharming. Why the other options are wrong: Skimming refers to capturing card data from ATMs or POS devices, not DNS manipulation; pretexting involves a fabricated story or role in direct interaction with the victim, not silent DNS redirection; wardriving is discovering wireless networks from a moving vehicle, not redirecting web traffic via DNS.

To deliver the malware, he used the current employees' email IDs to send fraudulent emails embedded with malicious links that seem to be legitimate.

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Phishing** Scenario recap: A disgruntled ex-employee sends fraudulent emails from current employees’ addresses with links to a fake website that automatically loads Flash and triggers a fileless exploit when victims click. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes phishing as sending deceptive emails or messages that contain malicious links or attachments to lure users to malicious sites; in this scenario the key technique is the social engineering delivery method (fraudulent emails and convincing links), even though the payload is fileless malware that runs via a drive-by exploit, so from the social engineering perspective this is phishing. Why the other options are wrong: In-memory exploits, legitimate applications, and script-based injection are technical categories of fileless malware execution and persistence, but they do not describe the human-facing technique used to trick users into clicking the link; the question asks for the technique the attacker used to launch the attack through users’ interaction, which is phishing.

Why this answer is correct: CEH highlights that many online quizzes and social media posts ask for favorite places, pet names, important dates, and other details that are routinely used as password-reset security questions by banks and other services; by honestly answering these public questions, Matt effectively handed an attacker the likely answers to his security questions, enabling a password reset and account takeover. Why the other options are wrong: The post does not explicitly ask for his password, so it is unlikely he revealed it directly; there is no evidence of a keylogger on Matt’s device in the scenario; brute forcing a bank account with no lockout or detection would be far less probable than simply abusing security-question flows that match the information Matt willingly revealed.

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Honey trap** Scenario recap: An attacker creates an attractive fake social media profile, befriends Stella, builds a relationship over time, and then gradually asks about her company until obtaining sensitive organizational information. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes a honey trap as a human-based social engineering technique in which an attacker uses an appealing or romantic persona to establish trust and emotional engagement so that the victim voluntarily reveals personal or corporate information; this exactly matches the attacker’s use of an enticing profile and flirtatious interaction to extract company details from Stella. Why the other options are wrong: Baiting usually involves offering something desirable (such as free media or software) to trick users into executing malware, not a prolonged romantic-style relationship; piggybacking and diversion theft are physical-world techniques related to unauthorized entry and redirecting goods or deliveries, not online relationship-building via social media.

Why this answer is correct: CEH defines quid pro quo as a social engineering technique where an attacker offers some service or benefit (often technical support or problem resolution) in return for access, actions, or information from the victim; in this scenario the attacker provides fake support and troubleshooting guidance while getting the victim to execute commands and install malware. Why the other options are wrong: Diversion theft focuses on misdirecting deliveries or physical goods; elicitation is about drawing out information through casual conversation rather than guiding the victim to install malware; phishing typically uses emails or messages with malicious links, whereas here the core method is a live voice interaction offering support in exchange for cooperation.

Why this answer is correct: CEH repeatedly states that no technical control alone can stop social engineering and that the primary and most effective countermeasure is continuous security awareness and training so that employees recognize and resist phishing, pretexting, baiting, and other social engineering tactics; after deploying technical monitoring, the logical next step is structured, recurring user education. Why the other options are wrong: Endpoint detection and response tools help with malware and endpoint behavior but do not directly address the human decision to trust or disclose information; honeypots are useful for studying attackers and misdirecting them but do not prevent employees from being tricked; more physical security personnel help against tailgating or physical intrusions but not against phone, email, or online social engineering campaigns.

Why this answer is correct: CEH describes whaling as a highly targeted form of phishing or social engineering that focuses on high-profile individuals such as executives and senior managers; here the attacker leverages the executive persona and associated trust to infiltrate the organization’s professional network and access sensitive information, which directly enables further targeted attacks such as tailored spear-phishing, business email compromise, or strategic data theft. Why the other options are wrong: Pretexting is involved in many attacks but the option given pairs it with generic network vulnerability rather than emphasizing high-value executive impersonation and targeted campaigns; spear phishing and spam focuses on email-based attacks, while this scenario centers on social networking and executive-level persona abuse; baiting and involuntary data leakage usually involve offering something desirable (files, media, or offers) rather than long-term impersonation of a senior leader.

Why the other options are wrong: A change management process is valuable for tracking system modifications but does not address how employees handle unsolicited information requests; a strict software policy focuses on unauthorized applications, not on what staff say over the phone; stronger physical security helps against tailgating and on-site impostors but would not have stopped a remote phone-based social engineering incident.
