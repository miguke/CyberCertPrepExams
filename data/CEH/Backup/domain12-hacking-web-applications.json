Why this answer is correct: CEH notes that file extensions like `.stm`, `.shtm`, and `.shtml` are commonly associated with pages processed for Server‑Side Includes; if `.stm` files are present and SSI is enabled, attackers may be able to exploit SSI injection or related vulnerabilities. Why the other options are wrong: `.cms`, `.rss`, and `.html` do not, by themselves, imply SSI processing and are not the classic indicators of SSI‑specific attack surface given in CEH materials. KEY CONCEPTS: SSI, `.stm` pages, server‑side includes processing, SSI attack surface. CEH REFERENCE: Module 14 – Hacking Web Applications (Server‑Side Includes and Vulnerable File Types)."

    "question": "Ron, a security professional, was pen testing web applications and SaaS platforms used by his company. While testing, he found a vulnerability that allows hackers to gain unauthorized access to API objects and perform actions such as view, update, and delete sensitive data of the company. What is the API vulnerability revealed in the above scenario?",

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: No ABAC validation** Scenario recap: Ron discovers an API vulnerability that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to API objects and perform actions such as viewing, updating, and deleting sensitive company data. Why this answer is correct: CEH, aligned with OWASP API Security, explains that missing or weak Attribute‑Based Access Control (ABAC) or object‑level authorization allows clients to access or manipulate resources they should not, leading to unauthorized operations on API objects; this matches the description in the scenario. Why the other options are wrong: Business logic flaws relate to incorrect workflows and process rules, not specifically to missing attribute‑based access checks; improper use of CORS concerns cross‑origin browser access, not core authorization of API objects; code injections (like SQLi or command injection) are different classes of vulnerabilities and do not directly describe broken object‑level access control. KEY CONCEPTS: ABAC, object‑level authorization, API access control weaknesses, OWASP API security risks. CEH REFERENCE: Module 14 – Hacking Web Applications (API Security and Broken Object‑Level Authorization / ABAC Failures)."
