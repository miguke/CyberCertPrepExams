Nicolas did NOT exploit the vulnerability; instead, he helped protect systems.\n\n• **White hat**: Ethical hackers who always follow a strict ethical code and obtain permission before testing. Nicolas did not obtain permission before discovering the vulnerability.\n\n• **Red hat**: Less common term, generally refers to hackers who aggressively attack other malicious hackers, or in some contexts, very aggressive pentesters. Nicolas did not attack anyone.\n\n**💡 KEY CONCEPTS:**\n• **Zero-day vulnerability**: Vulnerability unknown to the vendor, with no patch available\n• **Responsible Disclosure**: Ethical practice of reporting vulnerabilities to the vendor before public disclosure\n• **Gray hat ethics**: May discover vulnerabilities without authorization but don't exploit them maliciously.\n\n**📖 CEH REFERENCE:** Module 01 - Information Security Fundamentals > Hacker Classes"

Medium goes up to 6.9, not 6.0. This answer excludes vulnerabilities between 6.1 and 6.9 that are classified as Medium.\n\n• **3.9-6.9**: Incorrect because 3.9 still belongs to the LOW category (0.1-3.9).
