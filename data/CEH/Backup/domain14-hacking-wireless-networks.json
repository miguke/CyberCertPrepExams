Why this answer is correct: CEH explains that WPA3-Enterprise introduces a 192-bit security suite for high-security environments (government, finance, etc.), using stronger ciphers and hash functions such as GCMP-256 and HMAC-SHA384 and supporting ECDSA with a 384-bit curve; this matches the description exactly. Why the other options are wrong: WPA3-Personal uses SAE and strong encryption but does not specifically mandate the 192-bit security suite described; WPA2-Enterprise and WPA2-Personal are older standards and typically use CCMP/AES and HMAC-SHA1, not the 192-bit suite with GCMP-256 and HMAC-SHA384.

Why this answer is correct: CEH stresses that in open or public Wi-Fi environments where strong mutual authentication is difficult to impose on transient users, user awareness is a critical control; a captive portal that automatically appears when users connect and warns them to verify the SSID, avoid entering credentials on suspicious networks, and be cautious of duplicates can significantly reduce successful evil-twin attacks without adding client-side complexity. Why the other options are wrong: Regularly changing the SSID does not prevent an attacker from cloning the current SSID; MAC address filtering is ineffective in large public environments and easily bypassed via spoofing; WPA3 encryption improves confidentiality but does not inherently stop an attacker from cloning the SSID and establishing a bogus AP in parallel.

    "question": "A group of hackers were roaming around a bank office building in a city, driving a luxury car. They were using hacking tools on their laptop with the intention to find a free-access wireless network. What is this hacking process known as?",

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Wardriving** Scenario recap: A group of hackers drives around a bank office building in a car using tools on a laptop to locate free-access wireless networks. Why this answer is correct: CEH defines wardriving as the practice of moving around (usually in a vehicle) with a Wi-Fi-capable device and software to discover, map, and sometimes log wireless access points, particularly open or poorly secured ones; this precisely describes the scenario. Why the other options are wrong: Spectrum analysis focuses on measuring RF characteristics and interference, not specifically hunting for free-access networks; wireless sniffing captures traffic within range but does not inherently involve driving around to discover networks; GPS mapping may be used as part of wardriving but is not the attack technique itself. KEY CONCEPTS: wardriving, wireless network discovery, mapping open Wi-Fi. CEH REFERENCE: Module 16 – Hacking Wireless Networks (Wireless Reconnaissance Techniques Including Wardriving)."

    "question": "Which wireless security protocol replaces the personal pre-shared key (PSK) authentication with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) and is therefore resistant to offline dictionary attacks?",
    "options": [
      "Bluetooth",
      "WPA2-Enterprise",
      "WPA3-Personal",
      "ZigBee"
    ],
    "correct": [

    "domain": 14,
    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: WPA3-Personal** Scenario recap: The question asks which wireless security protocol replaces personal pre-shared key authentication with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) and is resistant to offline dictionary attacks. Why this answer is correct: CEH notes that WPA3-Personal uses SAE (dragonfly) instead of a simple PSK-based four-way handshake, providing mutual authentication and making offline dictionary attacks much more difficult; this is exactly the protocol described. Why the other options are wrong: Bluetooth and ZigBee are entirely different wireless technologies with their own security models; WPA2-Enterprise uses 802.1X/EAP with RADIUS, not SAE, and is not the personal mode successor specifically designed around SAE. KEY CONCEPTS: WPA3-Personal, SAE, dragonfly, offline dictionary attack resistance. CEH REFERENCE: Module 16 – Hacking Wireless Networks (WPA3 Modes and Their Authentication Methods)."

    "question": "An attacker identified that a user and an access point are both compatible with WPA2 and WPA3 encryption. The attacker installed a rogue access point with only WPA2 compatibility in the vicinity and forced the victim to go through the WPA2 four-way handshake to get connected. After the connection was established, the attacker used automated tools to crack WPA2-encrypted messages. What is the attack performed in the above scenario?",
    "options": [
      "Cache-based attack",
      "Timing-based attack",
      "Downgrade security attack",
      "Side-channel attack"

      2
    ],
    "type": "single",
    "domain": 14,
    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Downgrade security attack** Scenario recap: An attacker notices that a user and AP both support WPA2 and WPA3, sets up a rogue AP that only supports WPA2, forces the victim to connect using the WPA2 four-way handshake, and then cracks WPA2-encrypted messages. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes downgrade security attacks where an attacker coerces clients and APs to use a weaker protocol or cipher suite (for example WPA2 instead of WPA3) to exploit known weaknesses; here, by forcing a WPA3-capable client to perform a WPA2 handshake, the attacker enables traditional WPA2 key cracking, which is a textbook downgrade scenario. Why the other options are wrong: Cache-based and timing-based attacks are side-channel techniques and not primarily about forcing protocol version downgrade; side-channel attack is a generic class and does not specifically describe the forced fallback from WPA3 to WPA2 as in the question. KEY CONCEPTS: downgrade attacks, WPA2 vs WPA3, forcing weaker security modes, exploiting backwards compatibility.

    "question": "Morris, an attacker, wanted to check whether the target AP is in a locked state. He attempted using different utilities to identify WPS-enabled APs in the target wireless network. Ultimately, he succeeded with one special command-line utility. Which of the following command-line utilities allowed Morris to discover the WPS-enabled APs?",

    "domain": 14,
    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: wash** Scenario recap: An attacker wants to know whether target access points have WPS enabled or are locked and uses a special command-line utility to discover WPS-enabled APs. Why this answer is correct: CEH mentions the `wash` utility (part of the Reaver suite) as a command-line tool used to scan for WPS-enabled access points and list their status, including whether WPS is locked; this matches the need to identify WPS-enabled APs for further attacks. Why the other options are wrong: `net view` is a Windows command for enumerating network shares and computers, not WPS scanning; `macof` is a tool to flood switches with MAC addresses for CAM table attacks, unrelated to WPS; `ntptrace` is used for tracing NTP servers and has nothing to do with wireless or WPS discovery. KEY CONCEPTS: WPS vulnerabilities, `wash` tool, discovering WPS-enabled access points before brute-forcing PINs.
