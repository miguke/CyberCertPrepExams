    "question": "Robin, a professional hacker, targeted an organization's network to sniff all the traffic. During this process, Robin plugged in a rogue switch to an unused port in the LAN with a priority lower than any other switch in the network so that he could make it a root bridge that will later allow him to sniff all the traffic in the network. What is the attack performed by Robin in the above scenario?",

To manage nodes in the network, he uses MIB, which contains formal descriptions of all network objects managed by SNMP. He accesses the contents of MIB by using a web browser either by entering the IP address and Lseries.mib or by entering the DNS library name and Lseries.mib.

    "question": "A large corporate network is being subjected to repeated sniffing attacks. To increase security, the company's IT department decides to implement a combination of several security measures. They permanently add the MAC address of the gateway to the ARP cache, switch to using IPv6 instead of IPv4, implement the use of encrypted sessions such as SSH instead of Telnet, and use Secure File Transfer Protocol instead of FTP. However, they are still faced with the threat of sniffing. Considering the countermeasures, what should be their next step to enhance network security?",
