As the Lead Cybersecurity Analyst with CEH and CISSP certifications, your responsibility is to correctly identify the specific type of attack based on the following indicators: The attacks are exploiting a vulnerability in the target system's hardware, inducing misprediction of future instructions in a program's control flow. The attackers are strategically inducing the victim process to speculatively execute instructions sequences that would not have been executed in the absence of the misprediction, leading to subtle side effects. These side effects, which are observable from the shared state, are then utilized to infer the values of in-flight data. What type of attack best describes this scenario?",
