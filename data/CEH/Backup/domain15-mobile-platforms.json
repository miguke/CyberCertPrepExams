    "question": "Bobby, an attacker, targeted a user and decided to hijack and intercept all their wireless communications. He installed a fake communication tower between two authentic endpoints to mislead the victim. Bobby used this virtual tower to interrupt the data transmission between the user and real tower, attempting to hijack an active session. Upon receiving the user's request, Bobby manipulated the traffic with the virtual tower and redirected the victim to a malicious website. What is the attack performed by Bobby in the above scenario?",

The organization has adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, but they have recently experienced a phishing incident where an employee's device was compromised. In the investigation, you discovered that the phishing attack occurred through a third-party email app that the employee had installed. Given the need to balance security and user autonomy under the BYOD policy, how should the organization mitigate the risk of such incidents? Moreover, consider a measure that would prevent similar attacks without overly restricting the use of personal devices.",
