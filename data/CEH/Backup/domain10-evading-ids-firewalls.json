    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Obfuscating** Scenario recap: A professional hacker encodes packets using Unicode characters so that the company’s IDS cannot correctly interpret them, but the target web server can still decode and process them. Why this answer is correct: CEH explains that one common IDS evasion method is obfuscation, where attackers encode or transform payloads (for example, using Unicode, URL-encoding, or other encodings) so that signature-based IDS cannot recognize known attack patterns while the destination application or server still decodes them normally; this matches Kevin’s use of Unicode-encoded packets to slip past the IDS. Why the other options are wrong: Session splicing breaks payloads into many small segments to bypass pattern matching, not specifically Unicode encoding; using the urgency (URG) flag plays with TCP flag behavior and is not about content encoding; desynchronization is a session hijacking/IDS‑evasion tactic that alters sequence numbers to confuse state tracking, not to hide payloads via Unicode encoding.

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Idle scanning** Scenario recap: The question asks which firewall‑evasion scanning technique uses a quiet zombie system with low network activity and relies on its fragment/identification (IPID) numbers. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes idle scan as an advanced stealth technique in which an attacker uses a third‑party 'zombie' host with predictable IPID values to perform port scans; by observing changes in the zombie’s IPID, the attacker infers the target’s port states while hiding their own IP. This technique is useful for evading firewalls and logging systems because the traffic appears to originate from the zombie, and it explicitly relies on the zombie’s IPID behavior. Why the other options are wrong: Packet fragmentation scanning splits packets into small fragments to bypass simple filters but does not use a zombie’s IPID; spoofed source address scanning forges the source IP directly without relying on IPID‑based inference; decoy scanning sends additional spoofed packets to mask the real scanner but, again, does not depend on a low‑activity zombie and its IPID sequence.

Why this answer is correct: CEH defines a false positive as a condition where an IDS raises an alarm even though no attack is actually occurring (no attack – alert); here the traffic is authorized administrative access, but the IDS still triggers an intrusion alert, which fits the false positive definition. Why the other options are wrong: A true positive would mean the alert corresponds to a real attack, which it does not; a false negative would mean an attack happens with no alert; a true negative would be the absence of both attack and alert.

Why this answer is correct: CEH describes DNS tunneling as encapsulating arbitrary or malicious data inside DNS queries and responses (for example in subdomains or TXT records) to create a covert channel that traverses DNS infrastructure and often bypasses traditional firewalls and content filters; this is exactly what John is doing by using DNS as a data exfiltration and malware communication channel. Why the other options are wrong: DNSSEC zone walking is about enumerating signed zones, not tunneling data; DNS cache snooping checks which domains are cached on a resolver; DNS enumeration is an information‑gathering step to discover hosts and records, not a covert exfiltration technique.

Why this answer is correct: CEH explains that honeypot detection typically relies on behavioral and fingerprinting clues (timing, service responses, virtualization artifacts, special tools, etc.); simply running a brute‑force attack to 'verify vulnerability' does not reliably distinguish a real system from a honeypot and is more about exploitation level than detection. Why the other options are wrong: Probing system services and observing the three‑way handshake, response patterns, and banner behavior is a classic way to detect emulated or unnatural honeypot TCP/IP stacks; using honeypot detection tools like Send‑Safe Honeypot Hunter is directly intended to identify honeypots; analyzing MAC addresses to spot VMware or virtualized environments is also a known detection technique because many low‑interaction honeypots run in virtualized setups.

Why this answer is correct: CEH notes that YARA rules can be used not only to detect malware but also to characterize and whitelist goodware; by writing YARA rules that reliably match the specific benign files currently causing alerts, the IDS can treat those files as known‑good and suppress or reclassify the corresponding alerts, reducing false positives while leaving room for additional YARA rules targeting real threats. Why the other options are wrong: Focusing YARA rules only on known malware signatures improves detection but does not address existing false positives from benign files; restricting YARA inspection to a private database ignores files and traffic outside that repository; applying broad YARA rules to all files regardless of nature, without distinguishing goodware, risks *increasing* false positives, not reducing them.

Why this answer is correct: CEH notes that Honeyd is a low‑interaction honeypot that emulates many services and IPs, and that one way to detect it is through active TCP fingerprinting and subtle timing analysis; Honeyd responses often show characteristic timing or TCP stack behaviors different from real OS implementations, so time‑based SYN probing is specifically described as a technique to detect Honeyd installations. Why the other options are wrong: Detecting honeypots running on VMware typically involves checking virtualization artifacts such as MAC prefixes or device characteristics, not time‑based SYN fingerprinting; detecting Snort_inline honeypots relies on analyzing packet modification behavior (for example, how packets are altered or dropped); Sebek‑based honeypots are usually detected by looking for Sebek kernel artifacts, unusual read/write behavior, or other low‑level traces rather than pure TCP timing differences.
