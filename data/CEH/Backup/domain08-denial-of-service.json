He launched an attack on the DHCP servers by broadcasting forged DHCP requests and leased all the DHCP addresses available in the DHCP scope until the server could not issue any more IP addresses. This led to a DoS attack, and as a result, legitimate employees were unable to access the client's network. Which of the following attacks did Abel perform in the above scenario?",

Why this answer is correct: CEH describes a DHCP starvation attack as broadcasting a large number of bogus DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST messages to consume all available leases, which exactly matches the behavior in the scenario and directly results in denial of network access. Why the other options are wrong: A rogue DHCP server attack involves standing up an unauthorized DHCP server that gives out malicious configuration, not exhausting the scope of a legitimate server; VLAN hopping abuses switch or trunk misconfiguration to move between VLANs, not DHCP leasing; an STP attack manipulates Spanning Tree Protocol and root bridge election to redirect traffic for sniffing, not to deplete DHCP addresses.

Why this answer is correct: CEH explains that spoofed session flood attacks generate huge volumes of forged TCP session traffic with spoofed or invalid addresses to fill connection state tables and overwhelm inspection devices, which matches the description of creating many fake TCP sessions using SYN, ACK, and RST/FIN packets. Why the other options are wrong: A UDP flood attack simply sends high volumes of UDP packets to consume bandwidth or processing but does not focus on forging TCP sessions; a peer-to-peer attack abuses P2P clients or reflection via P2P networks to direct traffic to a victim rather than forging TCP session state; ping-of-death relies on oversized or malformed ICMP packets, not on complex sequences of spoofed TCP flags.

Why this answer is correct: CEH describes Slowloris as a slow HTTP attack in which an attacker sends incomplete HTTP headers or requests and periodically sends small chunks to keep connections alive, tying up threads or sockets and preventing the server from serving legitimate clients; this is exactly the pattern of partial HTTP requests described.

Why the other options are wrong: A Smurf attack uses ICMP echo requests to a broadcast address with spoofed source to amplify traffic but focuses on volume, not oversize packets; a UDP flood overwhelms bandwidth or CPU with high-rate UDP traffic but does not depend on exceeding packet-size limits; a pulse wave attack uses pulsed high-volume traffic from a botnet, again about traffic patterns, not malformed or oversized packets.

Why this answer is correct: In option m=90, b=15 the attacker exceeds the server’s maximum handled connections (100 > 90) and also maintains each connection for a relatively long time (15 seconds), maximizing D and therefore the period of unavailability; among the overloaded scenarios, this combination of overload and longer per-connection hold time produces the longest sustained impact. Why the other options are wrong: When m=105 or m=110 the server’s capacity exceeds the attacker’s 100 connections, so even with longer b the server should remain operational; when m=95, b=10 the server is overloaded (100 > 95) but each connection is held for a shorter time, so overall impact and duration are lower than in the m=90, b=15 case.

Why this answer is correct: CEH describes pulse wave DDoS as a botnet-driven technique where coordinated bots send large bursts of traffic in pulses, repeatedly saturating links and knocking services offline while quickly changing sources and patterns; using a distributed botnet makes the attack resilient to IP blocking and conceals the true controller behind many compromised systems. Why the other options are wrong: A protocol-based SYN flood may be effective but if launched from limited sources is more susceptible to IP-based mitigation and is less explicitly tied to the “pulse” pattern described in CEH; a volumetric flood or simple ICMP flood from a single compromised machine makes it easy to trace and block by source IP or upstream filtering, which contradicts the requirement to keep the attacker’s identity concealed and resist simple blocking.

Why the other options are wrong: Installing a newer server version does not immediately address a live volumetric attack; IP whitelisting can be impractical and dangerous during a DDoS, potentially locking out legitimate users and still not stopping spoofed or distributed traffic at the edge; simply increasing bandwidth may provide a slightly larger target but does not solve the underlying problem and is rarely sufficient against a determined DDoS.

Why this answer is correct: In CEH-style reasoning, the key condition for overload is simply r > h; in the scenario where h=1987, the attacker’s rate 2010 clearly exceeds the server’s safe capacity, and the option text explicitly states that this will cause potential unresponsiveness, matching the described overloading condition.

Why this answer is correct: In the scenario with f=490, s exceeds f by 10, so k=10 and the theoretical response time increase is 2^10 = 1024 times normal, representing the most extreme overload and the clearest case where the system will be effectively unusable under the flood. Why the other options are wrong: With f=510, the server’s capacity exceeds the flood rate, so no overload condition is met; with f=495 or f=505, s exceeds or roughly matches capacity only slightly, leading to k=5 or less and a far smaller performance degradation than the 2^10 explosion in the f=490 case, making them less likely to cause total collapse compared to the worst-case overload scenario.
