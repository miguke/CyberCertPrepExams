    "question": "Abel, a security professional, conducts penetration testing in his client organization to check for any security loopholes. He launched an attack on the DHCP servers by broadcasting forged DHCP requests and leased all the DHCP addresses available in the DHCP scope until the server could not issue any more IP addresses. This led to a DoS attack, and as a result, legitimate employees were unable to access the client's network. Which of the following attacks did Abel perform in the above scenario?",

    "question": "Jude, a pen tester working in Keiltech Ltd., performs sophisticated security testing on his company's network infrastructure to identify security loopholes. In this process, he started to circumvent the network protection tools and firewalls used in the company. He employed a technique that can create forged TCP sessions by carrying out multiple SYN, ACK, and RST or FIN packets. Further, this process allowed Jude to execute DDoS attacks that can exhaust the network resources. What is the attack technique used by Jude for finding loopholes in the above scenario?",

Each connection sends a byte of data every 'b' second, effectively holding up the connections for an extended period. Your server is designed to manage 'm' connections per second, but any connections exceeding this number tend to overwhelm the system. Given 'a=100' and variable 'm', along with the attacker's intention of maximizing the attack duration 'D=a*b', consider the following scenarios. Which is most likely to result in the longest duration of server unavailability?",
    "options": [
      "m=90, b=15: The server can manage 90 connections per second, but the attacker's 100 connections exceed this, and with each connection held up for 15 seconds, the attack duration could be significant.",

    "question": "A sophisticated attacker targets your web server with the intent to execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. His strategy involves a unique mixture of TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods, using 'r' packets per second. Your server, reinforced with advanced security measures, can handle 'h' packets per second before it starts showing signs of strain. If 'r' surpasses 'h', it overwhelms the server, causing it to become unresponsive. In a peculiar pattern, the attacker selects 'r' as a composite number and 'h' as a prime number, making the attack detection more challenging. Considering 'r=2010' and different values for 'h', which of the following scenarios would potentially cause the server to falter?",
    "options": [
      "h=1987 (prime): The attacker's packet rate exceeds the server's capacity, causing potential unresponsiveness.",
      "h=1999 (prime): Despite the attacker's packet flood, the server can handle these requests, remaining responsive.",

You have put measures in place to manage 'f' SYN packets per second, and the system is designed to deal with this number without any performance issues. If 's' exceeds 'f', the network infrastructure begins to show signs of overload. The system's response time increases exponentially (2^k), where 'k' represents each additional SYN packet above the 'f' limit. Now, considering 's=500' and different 'f' values, in which scenario is the server most likely to experience overload and significantly increased response times?",
