    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Spear-phishing attack** Scenario recap: An attacker targets an organization's industrial control systems by sending fraudulent emails with a malicious attachment to selected employees; one employee opens the email, the attachment installs malware on the sales software system, and the malware then propagates to other networked systems and damages industrial automation components. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes spear-phishing as a highly targeted phishing attack that uses crafted emails and malicious attachments to compromise specific users and deliver malware into internal networks, which is exactly how the ICS environment is breached in this scenario. Why the other options are wrong: An HMI-based attack focuses on directly compromising or abusing the human–machine interface of industrial systems, not on initial compromise by email; SMishing is phishing via SMS/text messages, not email; a reconnaissance attack is about information gathering, not delivering and executing malware that damages automation components. KEY CONCEPTS: spear-phishing, targeted email with malicious attachment, ICS/OT malware propagation, social engineering entry vector.

    "question": "Robert, a professional hacker, is attempting to execute a fault injection attack on a target IoT device. In this process, he injects faults into the power supply that can be used for remote execution, also causing the skipping of key instructions. He also injects faults into the clock network used for delivering a synchronized signal across the chip. Which of the following types of fault injection attack is performed by Robert in the above scenario?",
    "options": [
      "Frequency/voltage tampering",
      "Optical, electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI)",

    "domain": 16,
    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Power/clock/reset glitching** Scenario recap: An attacker performs a fault injection attack on an IoT device by briefly disturbing the power supply so that instructions can be skipped or misexecuted, and by injecting faults into the clock network that distributes a synchronized signal across the chip. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes power/clock/reset glitching as a class of fault injection in which very short, precisely timed glitches are introduced on power or clock lines so that the processor behaves unpredictably—skipping security checks, executing corrupted instructions, or enabling unintended code paths; this matches the scenario’s focus on manipulating both power and clock to achieve remote execution and control. Why the other options are wrong: Frequency or voltage tampering typically refers to more sustained overclocking or undervolting rather than short, carefully timed pulses designed to skip single instructions; optical or electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks inject faults using lasers or EM pulses directed at the chip, not by directly glitching the power or clock distribution; temperature attacks rely on exposing the device to extreme heat or cold to induce failures or timing drift, not on intentional, momentary glitches on power/clock/reset lines. KEY CONCEPTS: fault injection, power and clock glitching, instruction skipping, bypassing security checks in embedded/IoT devices.
