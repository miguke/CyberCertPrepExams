    "question": "Richard, an attacker, aimed to hack IoT devices connected to a target network. In this process, Richard recorded the frequency required to share information between connected devices. After obtaining the frequency, he captured the original data when commands were initiated by the connected devices. Once the original data were collected, he used free tools such as URH to segregate the command sequence. Subsequently, he started injecting the segregated command sequence on the same frequency into the IoT network, which repeats the captured signals of the devices. What is the type of attack performed by Richard in the above scenario?",
