Why this answer is correct: CEH notes that AES supports 128, 192 and 256-bit keys and that increasing key size increases security but also computational cost; a 192-bit AES key offers stronger security than 128-bit with less overhead than 256-bit, giving a practical middle ground, which is why the exam frames it as the balanced option.

Why this answer is correct: CEH defines key stretching as the process of taking a relatively weak or low-entropy key or password and processing it through an algorithm (often with repeated hashing or use of KDFs like PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt) to produce a stronger, longer key that is harder to brute-force. Why the other options are wrong: Public key infrastructure is a framework for managing certificates and public keys, not a technique for strengthening individual keys; key derivation functions are a broader category of functions used to derive keys, but the scenario emphasises strengthening against brute force, which is specifically the role of key stretching; key reinstallation is associated with Wi-Fi KRACK attacks, not key strengthening. KEY CONCEPTS: key stretching, brute-force resistance, repeated hashing, password-based key strengthening. CEH REFERENCE: Module 2 – Cryptography (Key Stretching and Password Hardening Techniques)."

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: Key escrow** Scenario recap: BitLocker encryption is enabled on Windows systems and a mechanism is implemented to recover cryptographic keys from Active Directory in case keys are lost. Why this answer is correct: CEH describes key escrow as an arrangement where a trusted third party (such as an organization or directory service) securely holds copies of encryption keys so that they can be recovered under defined conditions; storing BitLocker recovery keys in Active Directory is a classic example of key escrow. Why the other options are wrong: Key archival refers more generally to storing old or expired keys for historical or compliance reasons, not specifically for recovery of live disk encryption keys; certificate rollover and key renewal concern replacing keys or certificates with new ones, not storing copies for recovery. KEY CONCEPTS: key escrow, BitLocker recovery keys in AD, key recovery mechanisms, enterprise key management. CEH REFERENCE: Module 2 – Cryptography (Key Management: Escrow, Archival and Recovery)."

    "question": "Harper, a software engineer, is developing an email application. To ensure the confidentiality of email messages, Harper uses a symmetric-key block cipher having a classical 12- or 16-round Feistel network with a block size of 64 bits for encryption, which includes large 8 × 32-bit S-boxes (S1, S2, S3, S4) based on bent functions, modular addition and subtraction, key-dependent rotation, and XOR operations. This cipher also uses a masking key (Km1) and a rotation key (Kr1) for performing its functions. What is the algorithm employed by Harper to secure the email messages?",

    "explanation": "**CORRECT ANSWER: CAST-128** Scenario recap: A software engineer uses a symmetric-key block cipher based on a 12- or 16-round Feistel network with a 64-bit block size, large 8 × 32-bit S-boxes, modular addition and subtraction, key-dependent rotation, XOR operations, and specific masking (Km1) and rotation (Kr1) keys. Why this answer is correct: CEH notes that CAST-128 (CAST5) is a 64-bit Feistel block cipher with 12 or 16 rounds depending on key length and uses large S-boxes, key-dependent rotations, and separate masking and rotation subkeys, aligning with the description in the scenario. Why the other options are wrong: AES is a 128-bit block cipher with a substitution-permutation network structure, not a classic Feistel with 64-bit blocks; GOST uses 64-bit blocks but has different S-box and round structures; DES uses 16 rounds and 56-bit keys with different S-box configuration, not the CAST-128 design with Km and Kr subkeys.
