Sandboxes also provide detailed forensic information about malware actions, network communications, system modifications, and attack techniques. Traditional antivirus and anti-malware solutions rely on signatures and cannot detect zero-day threats, while heuristic analysis detects suspicious behavior but doesn't provide the comprehensive forensic capabilities that sandboxing offers.
