    "explanation": "If the security camera shows no traffic in the logs during testing, the most likely cause is that it is not placed on the proper VLAN for camera network traffic. Security cameras often operate on a dedicated surveillance VLAN for both performance and security isolation. Without being on the correct VLAN, the device may not be able to communicate with the recording server or management system. Configure the correct VLAN (A) ensures the camera is logically connected to the right network segment and can send/receive video data. Vulnerability scan (B) is important for security but would not restore connectivity in this setup phase. Disable unnecessary ports (C) is a hardening step done after confirming the device works. Conduct a site survey (D) is usually performed before installing the camera, to determine optimal placement and coverage, not after noticing no traffic.
