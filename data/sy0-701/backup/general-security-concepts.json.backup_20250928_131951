SDL provides comprehensive security integration. Security testing, code review, and penetration testing are important security activities but represent specific point-in-time assessments, while SDL specifically addresses the systematic integration of security throughout the entire development process from initial concept through ongoing maintenance and updates.

Adaptive security responds automatically to risk changes. Risk assessment evaluates potential threats, risk management encompasses overall risk handling, and risk mitigation reduces specific risks, but adaptive security specifically refers to dynamic, automatic adjustment of security measures based on current risk conditions and threat levels to optimize protection effectiveness through real-time responsiveness.

Security training specifically targets human vulnerabilities and behaviors. While training is implemented through administrative controls (policies and procedures), the underlying security concept being addressed is human factors - the recognition that humans are often the weakest link in security and that education and awareness are essential for creating secure behaviors and reducing human-related security risks.

Mobile device encryption protects stored data from unauthorized access if devices are lost, stolen, or compromised. Mobile application management focuses on app-level controls, mobile device management provides comprehensive device control, and data in transit protection secures data during transmission. Data at rest protection specifically addresses the security of stored information through encryption that ensures data confidentiality regardless of device possession or access.

Static security uses fixed configurations, perimeter security focuses on network boundaries, and network segmentation divides networks into zones, but adaptive security specifically refers to dynamic, intelligence-driven adjustment of security measures that automatically respond to current threat information and environmental changes to optimize protection effectiveness.

Digital signatures establish code authenticity and integrity. Data encryption protects information confidentiality, access control manages permissions, and network security protects communications, but code integrity specifically addresses software authenticity and tamper detection through cryptographic verification that ensures installed software is legitimate and has not been corrupted or modified by attackers.

    "explanation": "Secure configuration is supported by policies requiring default password changes before device deployment because secure configuration involves implementing security settings, removing default credentials, disabling unnecessary services, and applying security hardening measures to ensure systems are deployed in secure states. Changing default passwords is a fundamental secure configuration practice. Least privilege limits access scope, defense in depth uses multiple security layers, and separation of duties divides responsibilities, but secure configuration specifically addresses the systematic implementation of security settings and hardening measures including default credential changes that establish secure baseline configurations for systems and devices.

VPN policies specifically address network-level security concerns. While VPNs provide data encryption, access control, and may involve identity management, the primary security concept being addressed is network security - ensuring that remote connections maintain the same security posture as internal network connections through encrypted tunneling and secure network access protocols.
