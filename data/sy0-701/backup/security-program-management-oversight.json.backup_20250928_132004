    "explanation": "Security awareness training is most effective against social engineering because these attacks exploit human psychology, emotions, and trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. Training educates users to recognize manipulation tactics, verify requests through alternate channels, and respond appropriately to suspicious communications. Technical controls protect systems but don't address human manipulation, physical controls secure facilities but don't prevent psychological manipulation, and administrative controls provide policies but require human understanding to be effective.

Professional wiping services and tools are relatively inexpensive compared to physical destruction methods. Recycling doesn't remove data and creates security risks, shredding physically destroys drives but is expensive and prevents hardware value recovery, and simple deletion only removes file system references leaving data easily recoverable.

Since the state mandate (24/7 monitoring) encompasses and exceeds the federal mandate (business hours monitoring), implementing continuous monitoring satisfies both requirements simultaneously while maintaining the highest security posture.

Data controllers have primary responsibility for GDPR compliance including lawful basis, consent, and data subject rights.
