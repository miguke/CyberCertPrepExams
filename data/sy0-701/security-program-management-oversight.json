    "explanation": "Explanation: An information security policy embedded in the SDLC defines coding standards, access controls, and data handling requirements to prevent vulnerabilities during design, development, and deployment. Service-level agreements (A) govern operations, penetration testing (C) is typically performed post-development, and branch protection rules (D) apply to version control workflows but are narrower than a full security policy.

    "explanation": "Explanation: Rules of engagement specify scope, objectives, prohibited activities, data handling, scheduling, and reporting formats for a penetration test—ensuring the exercise is legal, ethical, and aligned to business goals. Supply chain analysis (B) assesses hardware/software origins; a right-to-audit clause (C) grants compliance checks; due diligence (D) is vendor evaluation, not test scoping.

    "explanation": "Explanation: An external examination (external audit) performed by third-party assessors benchmarks organizational policies against regulatory standards, providing an impartial compliance report. Penetration tests (A) find technical flaws, internal audits (B) review internal controls only, and attestation (C) is a statement of fact without in-depth evaluation.

    "options": [
      "To defend against insider threats altering banking details",

    "explanation": "Explanation: Corrective controls (e.g., auditing, versioning) are put in place after an error or unauthorized change has occurred to restore data integrity and prevent future tampering. While stopping error propagation (B) is related, the heart of corrective controls in financial contexts is detecting and rolling back unauthorized changes. Insurance (C) and insider threat defense (A) are secondary concerns. Lesson 5.4: Financial Controls and Compliance, p. 412",
