    "explanation": "Non‑repudiation – Digital signatures prove exactly who sent and signed a message. Adaptive identity is not a standard security control.

    "explanation": "When a critical legacy system can neither be updated nor replaced, the organization must acknowledge (accept) the risk and put compensating controls in place rather than transfer, avoid, or reject the risk. Transfer (A) would mean shifting the risk to a third party, which isn’t feasible here. Avoid (C) would require eliminating the system altogether, which isn’t possible given its criticality.

By restricting console access to just the IT manager and help-desk lead, the manager is ensuring no one else can make high-level changes—preventing accidental or malicious misuse.

In this scenario, if the administrator had been trained to identify phishing emails—looking for unexpected requests, mismatched URLs, or poor grammar—they would have been far less likely to change the password in response. Situational awareness (A) is broader, password managers (B) help with strong credentials but not social engineering, and reviewing policies (C) alone doesn’t teach staff how to spot phishing.
