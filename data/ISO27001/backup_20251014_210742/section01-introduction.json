Answer A is incorrect because it mentions 'guidelines and best practices' - while these may be part of management systems, the key characteristic of an IMS is to integrate business COMPONENTS (organizational structure, processes, resources), not guidelines. Answer C is incorrect because it refers to 'frameworks and resources' - an IMS is not primarily about integrating frameworks; it's about creating a coherent system from all business components including organizational structure, systematic processes, and associated resources (as detailed on pagee 29).
