This requires assessing both likelihood and impact for all identified risks, not just a subset. Answer B is incorrect - risk evaluation must consider both past incidents and potential future risks. Answer C is incorrect - all risks must be evaluated, not only those with major impact; even lower-impact risks need assessment. Answer D is incorrect - both internal and external risks must be evaluated. (Ref: Clause 6.1.2)",
