Day1 page 32 lists these benefits. Answer B (processing and removing redundant information) is incorrect - ISMS is not about management of redundant data, it is about security of the information. Answer C (exposing confidentiality) is incorrect - this completely contradicts the objective of the ISMS which is to PROTECT confidentiality, not expose it. (Ref: Day1, page 32)",
